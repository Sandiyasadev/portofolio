# n8n vs Zapier: Which Automation Tool Should You Choose in 2024?

When it comes to workflow automation, n8n and Zapier are two of the most popular choices. But which one is right for your business? Let's break it down.

## Pricing Comparison

**Zapier** operates on a task-based pricing model. The free tier gives you 100 tasks/month, but serious usage quickly pushes you into paid tiers ($19.99/month for 750 tasks).

**n8n** offers a fundamentally different approach. You can self-host it for free (unlimited executions), or use their cloud service starting at $20/month for 2,500 executions.

## Feature Deep Dive

### Code Flexibility
n8n wins hands-down for developers. You can write custom JavaScript/Python within any workflow, manipulate data freely, and even create custom nodes.

Zapier is more restrictive but easier for non-technical users. The Code by Zapier step exists but feels like an afterthought.

### Self-Hosting
This is where n8n truly shines. Deploy on your own servers, maintain full data control, and avoid vendor lock-in. Perfect for companies with strict compliance requirements.

Zapier? Cloud-only. No self-hosting option available.

## When to Choose n8n

- You have technical resources on your team
- Data privacy and self-hosting are priorities
- You need complex, multi-step workflows
- Budget constraints (especially at scale)

## When to Choose Zapier

- You need the simplest possible setup
- Your team is entirely non-technical
- You only need basic integrations
- You're okay with per-task pricing

## Conclusion

For most businesses serious about automation, **n8n offers better value and flexibility**. The learning curve is slightly steeper, but the payoff in customization and cost savings is substantial.

# How to Calculate ROI for Your Automation Projects

Automation is only valuable if it delivers measurable results. Here's how to calculate and communicate the ROI of your automation investments.

## The ROI Formula

At its simplest:

**ROI = (Time Saved × Hourly Cost) - Implementation Cost**

But there's more to consider:
- Error reduction value
- Opportunity cost of manual work
- Scalability benefits
- Employee satisfaction improvements

## Step 1: Document Current State

Before automating, measure:
- How long does the process take manually?
- How often is it performed?
- What's the error rate?
- Who performs it and what's their hourly cost?

## Step 2: Identify Automation Costs

Factor in:
- Development/implementation time
- Tool subscriptions (n8n, API costs, etc.)
- Ongoing maintenance
- Training time

## Step 3: Calculate Time Savings

Example calculation:

| Metric | Manual | Automated |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Time per task | 15 min | 0 min |
| Tasks per week | 100 | 100 |
| Weekly time | 25 hours | 0 hours |
| Annual time | 1,300 hours | 0 hours |

At $50/hour: **$65,000 annual savings**

## Step 4: Add Qualitative Benefits

Don't forget:
- Faster customer response times
- Reduced employee burnout
- Better data accuracy
- Scalability without hiring

## Real Example: Order Processing

A client's order processing automation:
- **Implementation cost**: $5,000
- **Annual time savings**: 2,080 hours
- **Error reduction**: $12,000/year in prevented mistakes
- **Total annual benefit**: $116,000
- **ROI**: 2,220%

## Conclusion

Calculate ROI before, during, and after automation projects. It justifies investment and helps prioritize future automations.
